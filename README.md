# Neural Style Transfer

This code is heavily borrowed from [this link](https://github.com/Shashi456/Neural-Style/tree/master/Neural%20Style%20Transfer).
- It is an attempt at learning how the neural algorithm works. The code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras is used only to import the weights. 
- The model used in the code is VGG19 : which comes under the category of very deep convolutional networks. 

It was tested on the following images :
